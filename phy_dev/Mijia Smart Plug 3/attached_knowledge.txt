Integration via Home Assistant Configuration:

You'll need to add entries to your configuration.yaml file under the switch domain.
Specify xiaomi_miio as the platform, along with the device's IP address and token.
Optionally, you can name your device for easier identification within Home Assistant.
Supported Devices:

The platform supports a range of models, such as chuangmi.plug.m1, chuangmi.plug.m3, chuangmi.plug.v2, and others, which include temperature attributes and allow control over the power state (on/off).
Retrieving the Access Token:

Getting the token might be the most challenging part. There are detailed guides available on how to retrieve this token, either via the Xiaomi Cloud Tokens Extractor tool or through the Xiaomi Home app. This step is crucial for the integration to work, as the token is required to authorize Home Assistant to control the device.
Example Configuration:

An example configuration in your configuration.yaml could look something like this, adjusting the host, token, and model to match your specific device:
yaml
Copy code
switch:
  - platform: xiaomi_miio
    host: YOUR_DEVICE_IP
    token: YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN
    name: Mijia Smart Plug 3
Additional Features:

Besides basic power control, some models also support USB power control, temperature readings, and more, depending on the specific model of the device you have.
Custom Component for Advanced Integration:

For a more advanced setup or if your device model isn't directly supported by the built-in xiaomi_miio platform, you might consider using a custom component available on GitHub that extends support to more devices and offers additional features like Wi-Fi LED control, setting power price, and power mode for power strips.
