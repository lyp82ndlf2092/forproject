To control the Mi Smart Desk Lamp Lite in HomeAssistant, you can use the python-miio library, which offers a comprehensive interface for interacting with Xiaomi IoT products, including lights and lamps. This library enables you to integrate Xiaomi devices with HomeAssistant by using the miiocli command line interface to interact with your devices, such as setting developer modes or retrieving tokens necessary for integration.

Here's a simplified guide based on the information gathered:

Python-Miio Installation: Begin by installing the python-miio package. This can be done using pip with the command pip3 install python-miio.
Device Token Retrieval: The next step involves retrieving the token of your Xiaomi device, which is essential for the integration. This can usually be accomplished by enabling LAN control in the Mi Home app and extracting the token from the app's log files. Alternatively, tools like "Get Mi Home Devices Token" can simplify this process.
Integration with HomeAssistant: Once you have the token, you can add the device to your HomeAssistant setup. For lamps and lights, you might use the Yeelight integration if applicable, specifying the device's IP address and the retrieved token in your configuration.
For lights and lamps, including those by Xiaomi, HomeAssistant has a built-in integration for Yeelight devices, which could also be compatible with your Mi Smart Desk Lamp Lite if it supports Yeelight's LAN control protocol. This integration allows for the control of various aspects of the light, such as brightness, color temperature, and power state, through HomeAssistant.

The specific steps and configurations might slightly vary based on the exact model of your lamp and the current version of HomeAssistant and its integrations. It's also important to ensure that your device firmware is up to date and that LAN control is enabled through the Mi Home app for your device.

For a detailed step-by-step guide and troubleshooting, refer to the python-miio documentation and the Yeelight integration page on the HomeAssistant official documentation site​​​​​​.
