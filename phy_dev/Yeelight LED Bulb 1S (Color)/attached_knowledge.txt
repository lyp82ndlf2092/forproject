APIs and SDKs for Yeelight LED Bulb 1S (Color)

Yeelight 3rd-party Control Protocol
This protocol is designed for developers and IoT enthusiasts, enabling the development of applications that can discover and control Yeelight WiFi devices within the same LAN. It uses a SSDP-like discovery mechanism and JSON encoded commands. It's important to note that all messages defined in this protocol are not encrypted, which means the security of Yeelight devices relies on the router’s security level.

Detailed information about this protocol can be found on the Yeelight Developer Website​​.

YeeLight Python Library
The YeeLight Python library facilitates control over Yeelight RGB LED bulbs via WiFi. While it does not support some features of the Yeelight API, like discovery, it is comprehensive for most control needs. The library allows for discovering bulbs on your network, and controlling their state, brightness, color, and more. It also supports effects, which control how the bulb transitions between states, and provides a way to listen for real-time state updates from the bulb.

To get started with the library, you can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install yeelight
And here are some examples of how to use it for device discovery and control:

python
Copy code
from yeelight import discover_bulbs
print(discover_bulbs())

from yeelight import Bulb
bulb = Bulb("192.168.0.19")
bulb.turn_on()
bulb.set_rgb(255, 0, 0)

More detailed usage examples and documentation can be found on the YeeLight library's documentation page​​.

These resources will provide you with the necessary tools and information to develop applications for controlling the Yeelight LED Bulb 1S (Color) and other Yeelight smart devices.

Web Content for Yeelight LED Bulb 1S (Color)

For programming the Yeelight LED Bulb 1S (Color) within HomeAssistant, you can utilize the Yeelight integration available in HomeAssistant. This integration supports a variety of features including smooth transitions, music mode, nightlight switch mode, and custom effects. The Yeelight LED Bulb 1S (Color) is identified under model IDs color4 (YLDP13YL/YLDP04YL) within the supported models list. The configuration requires specifying the device's IP address, a friendly name (optional), and additional settings such as transition timings, enabling music mode, and defining custom effects if needed.

To achieve full brightness for the Yeelight bulb, specific settings may be required. For instance, setting color_temp: 250 and brightness: 255 within the Yeelight integration can enhance brightness levels compared to using the HomeKit integration. Some users have found success in reaching full brightness by specifying a kelvin value within the range of 1700-6500, setting brightness to 255, and omitting parameters like color_temp, hs_color, rgb_color, and xy_color.

Yeelight bulbs also support control via the Yeelight application and integration with AI home assistants like Google Assistant, Samsung SmartThings, and Amazon Alexa. The bulbs feature built-in WiFi, requiring no additional hub, and offer an extensive color palette of 16 million colors, adjustable color temperatures, and dimmable settings to meet various lighting needs.

For more detailed information on the integration process and capabilities, you can refer to the official Home Assistant Yeelight integration documentation and the Yeelight community discussion for troubleshooting and user experiences​​​​​​.
